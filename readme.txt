Welcome to Paradata using Craft CMR

This product is based on a modular approach.  Each post in Craft should be tagged with a specific tag, which in turn will create a new object on the page.

To create a new page, just create a new Structure with the desired page name.  All posts will be under the desired pages Structure.
When you create a new structure, it automatically creates a new page, no further set up required.
Pages will be populated with all the content in its Structure, in the order on the Craft Dashboard. 

The avaliable tags are:
<!-- Picture header area -->
"pictureArea"

<!-- Text header area -->
"textArea"


  <!-- For regular posts -->
"post"

  <!-- for videos-->
"videoObject"

<!-- Picture objects -->
"pictureObject"

<!--  List object,  must have a list parent, with the objects as children-->
"listParent"


<!-- Three Wide Grid  children required-->
"threeWideGrid"

<!-- Dual Pane object  children required-->
"dualPane"
